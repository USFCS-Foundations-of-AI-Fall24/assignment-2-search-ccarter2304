Question 1: Algorithms. 10/10

Question 2:

eq: 5/5

goal: 5/5

BFS/DFS: 5/5

DLS: 7/10 - you're incrementing depth for each node dequeued, which is going
to give you an incorrect count. It's easier to make this a member variable 
of the node and then have each child's depth be parent + 1.

tools: 10/10

decomposition: 10/10

Question 3:

read_mars_graph: 5/5

A*: 10/15
A couple of things are off here:
- g should be calculated based on the parent's g, rather than a global
variable.
- You're not using the goal test to see if you're done.


count states: 5/5
